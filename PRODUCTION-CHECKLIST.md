   - [ ] Firewall rules configured

2. **Database/Storage**
   - [ ] Schema directory backed up
   - [ ] File permissions set (600 for configs)
   - [ ] Disk space monitored

3. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Prometheus configured to scrape metrics
   - [ ] Health checks added to load balancer
   - [ ] Alerts configured for critical metrics
   - [ ] Log aggregation setup

4. **Security**
   - [ ] API keys rotated
   - [ ] Access controls configured
   - [ ] Network policies applied
   - [ ] Security scan completed

5. **Performance**
   - [ ] Load testing completed
   - [ ] CDN configured (if applicable)

   - [ ] Feature flags configured

## 📝 Post-Deployment

1. **Verification**
   - [ ] Health checks passing
   - [ ] Metrics being collected
   - [ ] No error spike
   - [ ] Performance within SLA

2. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Watch error rates for 24h
   - [ ] Monitor memory usage
   - [ ] Check circuit breaker states
   - [ ] Review rate limiting effectiveness
