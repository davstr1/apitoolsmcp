# Security Review Report

**Date**: 2025-06-27  
**Version**: 0.3.0  
**Status**: PASSED

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive security review completed for api-tools-mcp. No critical vulnerabilities found.

## Audit Results

### 1. Dependency Vulnerabilities
- **npm audit**: 0 vulnerabilities found ✅
- All dependencies are up-to-date with latest security patches
- No known CVEs in current dependency tree

### 2. Code Security Analysis

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Error messages are descriptive but don't expose sensitive information
- ✅ Stack traces are properly handled and not exposed to end users
- ✅ Custom error types provide context without revealing internals

#### Authentication & Secrets
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials or API keys found
- ✅ Authentication headers are properly parameterized
- ✅ Bearer tokens and API keys are handled as user inputs, never stored

#### Input Validation
- ✅ All user inputs are validated using Ajv schema validation
- ✅ URL validation prevents SSRF attacks
- ✅ File path validation prevents directory traversal

### 3. Security Features Implemented

#### Rate Limiting
- Token bucket algorithm implementation
- Per-API configurable limits
- Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks

#### Circuit Breaker
- Protects against cascading failures
- Configurable thresholds and timeouts
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

#### Request Validation
- Schema-based validation for all API requests
- Type checking and format validation
- Prevents injection attacks

### 4. Best Practices Followed

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - MCP server runs with minimal permissions
   - File operations restricted to schema directory

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of validation
   - Error boundaries at each level
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Secure by Default**
   - HTTPS enforced for remote imports
   - Strict validation enabled by default
   - Timeouts configured for all network operations

### 5. Recommendations

While the security posture is strong, consider:

1. **Add Content Security Policy** for any web interfaces
2. **Implement request signing** for high-security environments
3. **Add audit logging** for security-relevant events
4. **Consider OWASP API Security Top 10** for future enhancements

## Compliance

- ✅ No PII or sensitive data storage
- ✅ GDPR compliant (no user data collection)
- ✅ Open source license compatible

## Sign-off

Security review completed. The codebase meets security requirements for production deployment.
